      <h2>About me</h2>
      <div class="about-content">
        <p>
          I'm a Full Stack Web Developer specializing in creating robust, scalable applications. 
          My journey began in college where I didn't even know how to start a computer, but I 
          discovered my passion for technology through my first programming language - C. From 
          those humble beginnings, I've grown into a developer who can architect complete 
          solutions from database to UI.
        </p>

        <p>
          As a Full Stack Developer, I design and implement secure, efficient APIs, manage 
          databases, and ensure seamless cloud integration. On the frontend, I craft visually 
          stunning interfaces that provide intuitive user experiences. My expertise spans the 
          entire development lifecycle, allowing me to bring complex visions to life.
        </p>

        <p>
          I started with C in my first year of college, then gradually expanded my skills to 
          JavaScript, Python, and modern frameworks. Through consistent learning, I've mastered 
          multiple tech stacks and development paradigms. What began as confusion about basic 
          programming concepts has transformed into a deep understanding of system architecture 
          and software engineering principles.
        </p>

        <p>
          When I'm not coding, you'll find me playing cricket or football - these outdoor 
          passions keep me balanced and energized. I believe the same strategic thinking and 
          teamwork from sports translates beautifully into software development.
        </p>

        <p>
          My career has taken me from academic curiosity to professional mastery, with 
          experiences at companies like Radiant Sage Ventures SproutsAI and Interra IT. Each project 
          challenges me to grow, and I'm always excited for the next problem to solve.
